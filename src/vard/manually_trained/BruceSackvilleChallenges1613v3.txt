 Heart for a truer Reconciliation, now by that 
 Noble Gentleman, my Love once spoke, come

 Edward: Bruce
 
 Sr. Edward Sackville's Relation 
 betwixt him and my Lord Bruce. 
 Worthy
 Worthy Sr as I am not ignorant so ought It be  
            as sensible of the false Aspersions authorless Tongues have left upon me in the Report  
            of the unfortunate passage which lately happened between my Lord Bruce, and my self which 
 as they are spread here so I may justly fear  
 they reign also where you are.
 
 There but two ways to Resolve doubts of  
 this nature, by Oath, or by sword.
 
 The first is due to Magistrates and Communicable 
            the other to such as maliciously slander., and impudently defer their own Observation, your Love 
 not my Merit assures me you hold me your 
 friend, which I esteem, and  am much desirous  
 to attain, do therefore the Right to understand  
 the Truth of that, and in my behalf, who are 
 or may be infected with sinister Rumours much 
 prejudicial to that fair Opinion I desire to  
 hold amongst all worthy persons and on the  
 faith of a Gentleman the Relation I shall 
 give, is neither more, or less then the bear 
            Truth, The enclosed contains the first Insinuation sent me from Paris by a Scottish  
 Gentleman who delivered it me in Derbyshire  
 at my father in Laws house.
 
 After it, follows my Accomplishment of my  
 first promise being a particular Assignation of 
 place
 
 place, and Weapons, which I sent by a Servant  
 of mine by Post from Rotterdam as soon as I landed  
            there, the Receipt of which joined with the acknowledgement of my too fair a Carriage to the 
 deceased Lord Bruce is testified by the last  
 which periods the business till wee met at Tergoes, he being accompanied with one Mr.  
 Cranfield an English Gentleman for his second 
 a Surgeon and a Man, whom he sent with all 
 speed he could to me, having once tendered 
 himself I addressed to my second Sr. John Heydon 
 to let him understand that now all things should 
 be done by Consent as concerning the Terms  
 whereon wee should fight, as also the place 
 by or seconds wee gave hour for these Appointments, who agreed wee should go to Antwerp 
 and from thence to Bergen op Zoom, where in the 
 nearest way, but a Village divides the States 
 Territories from the Archdukes, and there 
 was the destined Stage to the end that having 
 ended he that could might presently exempt  
 himself from the Justice of the Country, by 
 returning into the Dominion of the not offended
 
 It was further Concluded that in Case any 
 should fall, or slip that then the Combat  
 should
 
 should Cease, and he whose ill fortune had 
 so subjected him, was to acknowledge his life 
 to have bin in the others hands, But in Case one 
 party should break his Weapon, because that may 
 Come by Chance, or hazard, It was agreed that 
 the other should take no Advantage, but either  
 then be made Friends, or else by new terms  
 to go  to it again, thus these Conclusions  
 being by each of them related to his part  
 were by both of us approved, and sent accordingly  
 wee embarked for Antwerp and by reason, my 
            Lord (as I conceived, because he could not handsomely without danger of discovery had not 
 repaired his sword, I sent him from Paris one 
 of the same Length but twice as broad, my  
 second excepted against it and advised me to match 
 mine own, and send him the Choice, which I 
 obeyed (being as you know the Challengers 
 Privilege to elect the weapon at the delivery 
 of the swords which was performed by Sr John 
 Heydon, It pleased the Lord Bruce to make  
            election of my Sword, and then past Expectation he told him, that he found himself  
 so far behind hand, as a little of my blood 
 would not serve his Turn, And therefore 
 he was resolved to have me alone, because 
 he
 
 he knew (for I will use his own words) that 
 so worthy a Gentleman, and my friend could not  
 induce to stand by, and see him to do that which  
            he must to satisfy himself and his honour; Hereunto Sr: John Heydon replied, That such Intentions were bloody and butchery far unfitting a 
 Noble personage who should desire to bleed for 
 Reputation not for life, withal adding he thought 
 himself injured, being come that far to be prohibited from executing those honorable. Offices he 
 Came for. The Lord for Answer reiterated his 
 former Resolution, Whereupon Sr. John leaving 
 him the sword he had elected Delivered me the 
 other, with his Determination, the which., not the  
 matter, but manner (having eaten more liberally  
 at dinner than usual) And therefore unfit for 
 such an Action seeing the Surgeon held a  
            Wound upon a full Stomach much more dangerous then otherwise, I requested my second to certify him, I would decide the differences, And 
 therefore he should immediately meet me on 
 horseback, only waited on by or Surgeons, 
 they being unarmed together Wee rode (but 
 One before another some Twelve score; about 
            some two English Miles, Then passion having so weak an Enemy to assail at my 
 direction
 
 direction easily became victor, but using his 
 power, made me obedient to his Commandment  
 I being verily mad with anger the Lord Bruce  
            should thirst after my life with a kind of assuredness, seeing I had come so far, and needlessly 
 to give him Leave to regain his lost Reputation 
            I bid him alight, with all willingness he quickly granted, and there in a Meadow Ankle  
 deep in water at least bidding farewell to or 
 doublets in or shirts began to Charge each 
 other, having afore Commanded or Surgeons to 
 withdraw themselves a pretty distance from us conjuring them, besides as they respected or 
 favours, and their own safeness not to stir, but 
 suffer us to execute or pleasures, wee being fully 
 resolved (God forgive us) to dispatch each 
 other by what means wee could, I made thrust 
 at my Enemy, but was short, and drawing  
 back again mine Arm, I received a greater 
 Wound, with a blow thereon, which I interpret 
            as a Reward for my short Shooting, but in Revenge I pressed it to him again, though I then 
 mist him And then Receiving a Wound in my 
 Right Pap, which past level almost to my 
 back, And there wee wrestled for the two  
 greatest and dearest Prizes, wee could ever 
 expect
 
            expect trial for life and honour. In which struggling my hand having an Ordinary Glove on it 
 lost one of her Servants though the meanest which.  
 hung by the Skin, and to sight, yet remains  
 as before, and I am putt in hope one day to have the 
 use also, Butt at last, Breathless (yet keeping 
 or holds) there past on both Sides propositions of 
 quitting each swords, But when Amity was dead 
 Confidence would not live, and who should quit first 
 was the Question, which on neither part either 
 would perform striving afresh with a Kick, and to Wrench 
 together I freed my lunge Captived Weapon, which  
 incontinently I levied at his Throat (being Mr. 
 still of his) I demanded if he would ask his life 
            or yield his Sword both which though in that eminent danger he bravely denied to do, my self being 
 wounded, and feeling loss of Blood, having three 
 Conduits running on me, began to make me  
 faint, and he courageously persisting not to accord 
 to either of my propositions, remembrance of his 
 bloody desire, and feeling my present Estate I struck 
 at his heart, but with his avoiding mist him 
 again, yet past through his body, and drawing 
 forth my Sword repast it through again 
 another place. Then he cried out Oh I am slain 
 seconding his Speech, with all the force he had 
 to
 
 to Cast me, but being too weak after I had 
 defended his Assault, I easily became Mr of  
 him, laying him on his back, when being over 
 him, I demanded if he would request his life, but 
 it seemed he prized it not at so dear a Rate 
 to be beholding for it, bravely replying he 
 scorned it, which Answer of his was so noble 
 and worthy, as I protest I could not find in my 
 heart to offer any more Violence, only keeping 
 him down till at length his Surgeon far 
 off cried out immediately he will die if his wound 
 were not stopped, whereupon I asked if he  
 desired his Surgeon should Come which he 
 accepted of, (and so being drawn away I 
            never offered to take his sword from him, accounting it an inhumane part to rob a dead man for 
 so I accounted him to be.
 
 This thus ended I retired to my Surgeon in 
 whose Arms (after I had remained a while for 
 want of blood I lost my life also, but strong 
 waters, and his diligence quickly recovered me 
 when I escaped a great danger, for my Lords 
 Surgeon, when no body dreamt of it Ran 
 at me with his Lords sword, had not not mine 
 with my sword interposed himself, I had bin 
 by those base hands slain Although the Lord  
 Bruce weltering in his own blood, and past  
 Expectation of life conformable to all his former. 
 Carriage  
 Carriage, was undoubtedly Noble Cried out 
 Rascal hold thy hands.
 
 So may I prosper as I have 
 dealt sincerely with you in this  
 Relation, which I pray you with 
 the enclosed Letter to deliver to 
 my Lord Chamberlain And  
 so &c.
