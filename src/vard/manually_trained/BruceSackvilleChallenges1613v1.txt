 A challenge received by mr Sackville now earl of Dorset  
 from the Lord Bruce a Scottish Baron who fought in Zeeland 1614  
 where Bruce was slain
 
 A monsieur Monsieur Sackville
 
 I that am in France hear howe much you attribute to your self in this time  
 that I have given the world to ring your praises and for me the truest  
 Almanac to tell you how much I suffer And if you call to memory when  
               I gave you my hand last I told you I reserved the heart for a truer reconciliation Now be that Noble gentleman my love once spoke of and come and do him  
 right that would recite the trials you owe your birth & Country were I not  
 confident your honour gives you the same Courage to do me right that it did  
 to do me wrong Be mr of your own weapons & time the place wheresoever  
 I will wait on you by doing this you shall shorten revenge & clear the idle  
 opinion the world hath of both our words  
 E: Bruce 
 
 A monsieur Monsieur le Baron de Kinloss
 
 As it shall be always far from me to seek a quarrel so will I always  
 be ready to meet with any that desire to make trial of my valour by so fair  
 a Course as you require A witness whereof your self shall be who  
 within a month shall receive a strict account of time place and  
 weapon where you shall find ready disposed to give you honourable satisfaction  
 by him that shall conduct you thither In the mean time be as  
 secret of the appointment as it seems you are desirous of it.  
 Ed: Sackville
 
 I am ready at Tergoes a town in Zeeland to give you what  
 satisfaction your sword can render you, accompanied with a worthy  
 gentleman for my second in degree a knight And for ye coming  
 I will not limit you a peremptory day but desire you to make  
 it definite and speedy for your own honour and fear of prevention  
 until which time you shall find me there  
 E: Bruce  
 I have received your letter by your man and acknowledge you  
 have dealt nobly with me And now I come with all  
 speed to meet you  
 Ed: Sackville
