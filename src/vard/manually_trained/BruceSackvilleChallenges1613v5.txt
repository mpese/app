 Mr. Edward Sackville's  
 Letter to a friend of  
 the manner of the  Combat and death:  
 Betwixt him and the Lord Bruise  
 Baron of Kinloss  
 1613  Mr. Ed: Sackville's relation of his Combat
 Worthy Sir I am not ignorant, so ought  
 I to be sensible of the false aspersions  
 some authorless tongues have laid upon  
 me; in the reports of the unfortunate passage  
 lately happened between the lord Bruise  
 and my self which as they are spread  
 here so may I justly fear they  
 reign where you are, there are but  
 two ways to resolve doubts of this nature  
 by oath or sword: the first is due to  
 Magistrates and Communicable to friends 
 the other to such as maliciously slander  
 and impudently defend their assertion  
 your love not my merit assures me  
 You hold me a friend which esteem I  
 am so desirous to retain do me  
 the right to understand the truth of  
 that and in my behalf inform others  
 who either are or may be infected with  
 sinister rumours much prejudicial to  
 that fair opinion I desire to hold amongst  
 all worthy persons and on the faith of  
 a gentleman the relation I shall give  
 is neither more or less then the bare  
 truth, The enclosed Contains the  
 first Citation sent me from Paris by  
 a Scottish gent. who delivered it to me  
 in Derbyshire at my father in laws  with the Lord Bruise:.
 house; After it follows my then answer  
 returned him by the same bearer  
 the next is the Accomplishment of my  
 first promise being a particular assignation  
 of place and weapons which I sent by a  
 servant of mine by Post from Rotterdam  
 as soon as I landed there, the Receipt  
 of which with an acknowledgment of my  
 too fair carriage to the deceased Lord  
 is testified by the last which periods that  
 business till  we met at Tergoes  
 in Zeeland It being the place allotted for  
 Rendezvous where he accompanied with one  
 mr Crayford an English gent for his  
 second, a Surgeon and a man arrived  
 with all the speed he cold and there  
 having once rendered him self, I  
 addressed my second Sir John Heydon to let  
 him understand that now all followed  
 should be done by Consent as concerning  
 the Terms whereon  we should  
 fight as also the place. to our seconds we  
 gave power for these appointment who  
 agreed we should go to Antwerp from  
 thence to Bergen upon Zoom where in the mid  
 way but a village divided the States Territories  
 from the Archduke and there was the destined  
 stage to the end that having ended he that  
 Cold might presently exempt himself  Sir Ed: Sackville's relation of the Combat.
 himself from the justice of the Country  
 by retiring into the dominion not offended  
 It was further concluded that in case any  
 should fall or Slip that then the Combat  
 should cease and he whose ill fortune had  
 so subjected him was to acknowledge his  
 life to have been in the others hands, but in  
 Case one parties sword should break (because  
 that cold only Chance by hazard) it was  
 agreed that the other should take no  
 advantage but either be made friends or  
 upon even terms to go to it again, thus  
 these Conclusions being by each of them  
 related to his party was by us both approved  
 and assented unto, Accordingly we embarked  
 for Antwerp and by reason my lord as I  
 Conceive because he cold not handsomely  
 without danger of discovery had not paired  
 the Sword I sent him at Paris bringing one  
 of the same length but twice as broad,  
 My second excepted against it and advised me  
 to match my own and send him the Choice  
 which I obeyed (it being as you know the  
 Challenger's privilege to elect his the weapon  
 at the delivery of these swords which was  
 performed by Sir John Heydon it pleased  
 the Lord Bruise to choose my own  with the Lord Bruise.
 my own and then (paste expectation)  
 I told him that he found him self so  
 far behind hand as little of my bloods  
 would not serve his turn and therefore  
 he was now resolved to have me alone  
 because he knew for (I will use his own  
 words) that so worthy a gent. and my friend  
 Could not endure to stand by and to see him  
 do that which he must to satisfy  
 him self and his honour, Hereupon Sir John  
 Heydon replied such intentions were bloody  
 and butchery far unfitting so noble a  
 personage who should desire to bleed for  
 reputation not for life with all adding  
 he thought him self Injured (being come  
 this far) now to be prohibited from  
 executing those honourable offices he came for  
 The lord for answer only reiterated  
 his former resolution, whereupon Sir John  
 leaving him the sword we had elected  
 delivered me the other with his determination  
 the which (not for matter but manner)  
 so moved me as though to my Remembrance  
 I had not of a lunge while eaten more  
 liberally then at dinner and therefore  
 unfit for such an action, saying the Surgeons

 my second to Certify him I would presently  
 decide the difference, and that therefore  
 he should immediately meet me on  
 horseback at that gate of the Town  
 where the lot should direct us, the names  
 of the Ports being putt into a hat.  
 and he drawing it happened to be the  
 fate that led to Lillos, of this Course  
 he accepted and forthwith we met  
 at the forenamed place where being  
 searched by our seconds we were turned  
 together on horse back only waited on  
 by our Surgeons, they being unarmed

 to withdraw them selves a pretty distance  
 from us, Conjuring them besides as  
 they respected our favours, or their own  
 safety not to stir but suffer us to  
 execute our pleasures we being fully  
 resolved (god forgive us) to dispatch each  
 other by what means we Could, I  
 made a thrust at my enemy but was  
 short, and in drawing back my arm  
 I received a great wound with a blow  
 thereon which I interpreted as a reward  
 for my short shooting but in revenge  
 I pressed into him though I missed him  
 also and then received a wound in
