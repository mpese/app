 Answer.
 
 A Monsieur Monsieur Sackville.

 have dealt nobly with me and now  
 I Come with all possible haste to see  
 you.

 					Mr Edward  Relation of the Combat
 Mr. Edward Sackville's letter  
 to a friend of the manner  
 of the Combat, and death  
 Betwixt him and the Lord  
 Bruise Baron of Kinloss.  
 1613 
 
 Worthy Sir  
 I am not ignorant (so ought I to  
 be sensible) of the false aspersions  
 some authorless tongues have laid  
 upon me, in the reports of the  
 unfortunate passage, lately happened  
 between the lord Bruise and my  
 self, which as they are spread  
 here so may I justly fear, they  
 reign also where you are, There  
 				are The Relation of the Combat 
 There are but two ways to resolve  
 doubts of this nature, either by oath  
 or sword, the first is due to magistrates 
 and Communicable to friends, the  
 other to such as maliciously slander  
 and Impudently defend their assertion,  
 your love not my merit assures me  
 you hold me a friend which esteem  
 I am so desirous to retain, Do me  
 the right to understand the truth  
 of that, and in my behalf inform  
 others, who either are or may be  
 infected with sinister Rumours, much  
 prejudicial to that fair opinion  
 I desire to hold amongst all worthy  
 persons, and on the faith of a gentleman  
 the relation I shall give you is neither  
 more or less then the bare truth.  
 					The The Relation of the Combat. 
 The Enclosed Contains, the first  
 Citation sent me from Paris  
 by a Scottish gentleman who delivered  
 it to me in Derbyshire at my  
 father in laws hows, After it  
 follows my answer returned him by  
 the same bearer, the next then  
 is the Accomplishment of my first  
 promise, being a particular assignation  
 of place and weapons which I  
 sent by a servant of mine by  
 Post from Rotterdam, as soon as  
 I landed there, the receipt  
            of which joined with an acknowledgment of my too fair Carriage  
 towards the deceased lord is  
 testified by the last, which periods

 				Tergoes The relation of the Combat 
 Tergoes in Zealand, It being  
 the place allotted for Rendezvous  
 where he accompanied with one  
 mr Crayford an English gentleman  
 for his second a Surgeon and  
 a man, arrived with all the speed  
 he Cold, and there having  
 once rendered himself, I addressed  
 my second Sir John Heydon to  
 let him understand, that now  
 all followed should be done  
 by Consent, As concerning the  terms whereon wee should  
 fight, as also the place, To our  
 seconds wee gave power for  
 these appointments who agreed  
 wee should go to Antwerp  
 from thence to Bergen upon Zoom

 wherein the mid way but a village  
 divides the States territories from  
 the Arch Dukes, and there was  
 the destined Stage to the end  
 that having ended he that Could  
 might presently exempt him self  
 from the Justice of the Country,  
 by retiring into the Dominion  
 not offended; It was further  
 Concluded that in Case any should  
 fall or slip, that then the Combat  
 should cease, and he whose ill  
 fortune had so subjected him,  
 was to acknowledge his life to  
 have been in the others hands, but  
 in Case one parties sword should  
 break (because that might chance  
 				by The relation of the Combat 
 by hazard) It was agreed that  
 the other should take no advantage  
 but either then be made Friends  
 or else upon even terms go to  
 it again, Thus these Conclusions  
 being by each of them related  
 to his party, and by us both approved  
 and assented unto; Accordingly  
 wee embarked for Antwerp  
 and by reason my lord (as I conceive  
 because he could not handsomely  
 without danger of Discovery) had  
 not paired the sword I sent him  
 at Paris, bringing one of the  
 same length but twice as broad, My  
 second excepted against it, and  
 advised me to match my own  
 and to send him the Choice  
 			which The relation of the Combat 
 which I obeyed (it being as you  
 know the Challenger's privilege to  
 elect his weapon) at the delivery  
 of the swords which was performed  
 by Sir John Heydon it pleased the  
 Lord Bruise to Choose my sword  
 and then (past expectation) I told  
 him that he found him self so  
 far behind hand, as little of my  
 blood would not serve his turn  
 and therefore he was now resolved  
 to have me  alone, because  
 he knew (for I will use his own  
 words) that so worthy a gentleman  
 and my Friend Could not endure  
 to stand by and see him do that  
 which he must satisfy him self and  
 his honour, Hereupon Sir John  
 				Heydon The relation of the Combat. 
 Heydon replied, such Inventions were  
 bloody and butchery far unfitting  
 so noble a personage, who should  
 desire to bleed for reputation not  
 for life withal adding he thought  
 himself Injured (being come thus  
 far) now to be prohibited from  
 executing those honourable offices  
 he came for, the lord for answer  
 only reiterated his former resolution,  
 whereupon Sir John leaving him the  
 Sword he had elected, Delivered  
 me the other, with his Determinations

 so moved me as though to my  
 remembrance I had not of a

 then at dinner, and therefore  
 unfit for such an Action, seeing  
 the Surgeons hold a wound upon a  
 full stomach much more dangerous  
 then otherwise, I requested my  
 second to Certify him, I would  
 presently decide the difference, and  
 that therefore he should immediately  
 meet me on horseback at that  
 gate of the Town where the lot  
 should direct us, the names of the  
 Ports being putt into a hat, and  
 he drawing it, it happened to be  
 the gate that led to Lillos, of  
 this Course he accepted and forthwith  
 wee met, at the fore named place  
 				where The relation of the Combat 
 where being searched by our seconds  
 wee were turned together on

 Surgeons they being unarmed together  
 wee rode, (but one before the other  
 some 12 score) about some two English  
 miles, and then passion having so  
 weak an enemy to assail, as my  
 direction easily became Victor  
 and using his power made me  
 obedient to his Commandment, I being  
 verily mad with anger, that the lord  
 Bruise should thirst after my life  
 with a kind of Assuredness seeing  
 I had come so far, and needlessly  
 to give him leave to regain his lost  
 Reputation, I bade him alight which

 as a reward for my short shooting

 then received a wound in my  
 right pap which paste level  
 through my body almost to my back

 hold on my sword , I on his,
