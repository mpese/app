 call to Memory, when I gave you my hand 
 last, I told you I reserved the heart for a 
 truer Reconciliation, Now by that noble 
 gentleman my Love once spoke, and come, and

 Courage to do me Right, that it did to do 
 me wrong, Be Mr: of your: own weapons,

 Revenge, and clear the idle opinion the 
 world hath of both our honours:

 within a Month shall receive a strict Account of 
 time, place, and weapon, where, you shall find me

 be as secret of the Appointment: as it seems you 
 are desirous of it:

 I have Received your: Letter, by your: Man, and acknowledge you have dealt nobly with me, And now 
 I come with possible haste to meet you: 
 				Edward Bruce
 
 Sir Edward Sackville his 
 Relation of the fight, Between him 
 and the Lord Bruce: 
 Worthy: Sr: as I am not ignorant (so ought 
 I to be sensible) of the False Aspersions Authorless 
 Tongues have laid upon me, in the Reports of 
 the unfortunate passage, lately happened, Between 
 the Lord Bruce, and my self, which as they are  
 spread here, so may I justly fear they Reign 
 also where you are, 
 There: are but Two ways to Resolve doubts, 
 of this nature, By oath, or by sword, The first 
 is due to Magistrates, and Communicable to friends, 
 The other to such, as Maliciously slander, and  
 impudently defend their Assertion, your: Love, not 
 my merit Assures me, you hold me your: friend, 
 which I esteem I am much desirous to Retain, do 
 therefore the Right to understand the truth of that, 
 and in my behalf to inform others, who either 
 are, or may be infected with sinister Rumours. much 
 prejudicial to that fibber opinion I desire to hold 
 amongst all worthy Persons, And on the faith of 
 a gentleman the Relation I shall give, is neither more nor 
 less, Then the Bare truth:
 
 The: enclosed Contains the first Citation, sent 
 me from Paris, by a Scottish gentâ€™, who delivered 
 it me in Derbyshire at my father in Laws hows,
 
 After: it follows my then Answer returned him 
 by the same Bearer,
 
 The: next is, my Accomplishment: of my first 
 promise, being a particular Assignation of place, 
 and weapon, which I sent by a servant of mine by 
 Post from Rotterdam, as soon as I landed there: 
 The Receipt of which., joined with an acknowledgment: 
 of my to fibber Carriage to the deceased Lord, is 
 Testified by the last, which Periods the Business, 
 till we met at Tergoes in Zealand, it being a 
 place Allotted for Rendezvous, where he accompanied  
 with Mr: Cranfforde an English gentleman, For, 
 his second, a Surgeon, and a Man, Arrived with  
               all the speed he could, and there having once Rendered himself, I Addressed my second, Sr: John Heydon, 
 to let him understand, that now all following should 
 be done by Consent, As Concerning the Terms 
 whereon we should fight, As also the place, To 
 our seconds we gave power for their Appointments, 
 who Agreed we should go to Antwerp, from thence 
 to Bergen op zoom, where in the midway, but 
 a village divides the States Territories from 
 the Archdukes, and there was the destined stage, to 
 the end that having ended, he that could might 
 presently exempt himself from the Justice of the  
 Country, by Retiring into the dominion not offended: 
 
 It: was further Concluded, that in Case any should 
 fall, or slip: that then the Combat should Cease, 
 and he whose ill fortune had so subjected him, 
 was to acknowledge his life to have been in the others 
 hands, But in Case one parties sword should  
 Break (Because that could only Chance by hazard) 
 It was agreed that the other should take no advaun 
 advantage, But either then be made friends, or else by 
 even Terms go to it again;
 
 Thus: these Conclusions being by each of them 
 Related to his party, were by both of us Approved, and  
 Assented to, accordingly, we embarked, for Antwerp, 
 And by reason my Lord (as I Conceive because he could  
 not handsomely without danger of discovery) had 
 not paired his sword, I sent him at Paris, one of the 
 same length but twice as Broad, My second excepted  
 against it, and Advised me to Match mine own, 
 and sent him the Choice. which I obeyed (it being as 
 you know the Challengers: privilege to elect the 
 weapon), At that delivery of the swords (which was 
 performed by Sr: John Heydon, It pleased the Lord 
 Bruce to Choose mine own, and then past expectation, 
 he told Sr: John Heydon, that he found himself 
 so far behind hand, as a little of my Blood, 
 would not serve his turn, And therefore he was 
 now Resolved to have me alone, Because he knew, 
 (for I will use his own words) that so worthy a 
 gentleman, and my friend could not endure to stand 
 by, and see him do that he must to satisfy himself, 
 and his honour:
 
 Hereunto: Sr: John Heydon Replied, that such 
 intentions, were Bloody, and Butcherly, far 
 unfitting so noble a Personage, who should desire 
 to bleed for Reputation , not for life, withal Adding 
 he thought himself Injured, being come this 
 far, now to be prohibited from the executing  
 those honourable: offices he came for:
 
 The: Lord for Answer only Reiterated his 
 former Resolution:
 
 Whereupon: Sr: John leaving him the 
 sword he had elected, delivered me the other, with 
 his determination, The which, (not matter but manner) 
 so moved me, Although to my Remembrance I had  
 not of a lunge time eaten more Liberally then at 
 dinner, and therefore unfit for such an Action,  
 seeing the Surgeons hold a wound upon a 
 full stomach much more dangerous then otherwise, 
 I requested my second to Certify him, I would 
 presently decide the difference, and therefore he 
 should immediately meet me on horseback, only 
 waited on by our Surgeons they being unarmed:
 
 Together: we Rode, (But one before the other 
 sum twelve score) about some two English Miles, 
 and there passion having so weak an enemy  
 to Assail, as my direction, my passion easily become 
 victor, and using his power made me obedient to 
 his Commandment: I being verily mad with Anger, 
 the Lord Bruce should thirst after my life, with  
 a kind of Assuredness, seeing I had come so far, 
 and needlessly to give him leave to Regain his 
 lost Reputation, I Bad him alight, which with all 
 willingness he quickly granted, and there in a 
 Meadow (Ankle deep in water at the least) 
 Bidding farewell to our doublets, in our shirts 
               began to Charge each other, having afore Commanded our Surgeons to withdraw themselves a 
 pretty distance from us, Conjuring them besides, 
 as they respected our favours: or their own safeties, 
 not to stir, But suffer us to execute our pleasures,  
               we being fully resolved, (god forgive us) to dispatch  each other by what means we could:
            
 I: made a Thrust at  mine enemy, But was 
 short, and in drawing Back mine Arm, I 
 received a great wound, with a Blow thereon, 
 which I interpreted as a Reward for my short 
 shooting, But in Revenge, I pressed it to him, though 
 I then mist him also, And then receiving a 
 wound in my Right pap, which past level through 
 my Body, and almost to my Back, and there 
 we wrestled for the two greatest, and dearest 
 prises we could ever expect, Trial for honour: 
 and life; In which wrestling, my hand having 
 but an ordinary glove on it) lost one of his 
 Servants (though the meanest:) which hung by the 
 skin, And to sight yet remains as before, and 
 I am putt in hope, one day to have the use also, 
 But at last Breathless (yet keeping our holds) 
 there past on both sides Propositions of quitting each 
               others sword, But when Amity was dead, Confidence could not lyve, and who should quit first, 
 was the question, which on neither part, either 
 would perform; Restriving a fresh, with a 
 Kick, and a Wrench together, I freed my lunge 
 Captived Weapon, which incontinently levelling 
 at his throat, (being Mr: still of his) I demanded 
 if he would Ask his life, or yield his sword, 
 which both (though in that eminent danger) he 
 Bravely denied , to do, My self being wounded 
               and feeling loss of Blood (having three Conduits Running in me) Began to make me faint,  
 and he Courageously persisting not to Accord 
 to either of my propositions, Remembrance of his 
 former Bloody desire, and feeling my present 
 estate, I stroke at his heart, But with his avoiding 
 mist him again, yet past through the Body, 
 and drawing thorough my sword, Repast it through 
 again through another place, when he Cried, 
 Oh I am slain, seconding his speech, with all the 
 force he had to cast me, But being to weak, 
 after I had defended his Assault, I easily become 
 Mr: of him, laying him on his Back, when being  
 over him, I redemanded if he would Request 
 his life, But it seemed he prized it not at so 
 dear a Rate, as to be beholding for it, Bravely 
 Replying he scorned it, which Answer of his 
 was so noble, and worthy, as I protest, I could 
               not find in my heart to offer him any more violence, only keeping him down till at length his 
               Surgeon a far of Cried out, he would immediately dye, if his wounds were not stopped, whereupon I asked, if he desired his Surgeon 
 should come, which he Accepted of, and so being 
 drawn a way I never offered to take his sword from 
 him, Accounting it inhumane to Rob a dead Man 
 for so I Counted him to be)
 
 Thus: their ended, I Retired to my Surgeon, in 
 whose Arms, After I had Remained a while, for want 
 of Blood, I lost my sight, and with all, (as I then 
 thought) my life also; But strong water, and his 
 diligence quickly Recovered me, when I escaped  
 a great danger, for my Lords Surgeon, when 
 no Body dreamt of it, Ran full at me, with 
 his Lords sword and had not mine with my sword 
 interposed himself, I had been slain by those base 
 hands, Although the Lord Bruce, weltering in 
 his own Blood, and past expectation of life, Con= 
 Conformable to his former Courage which was undoubtedly noble, Cried out, Rascal hold thy 
 hands:
 
 So: may I prosper, as I have dealt sincerely 
 with you in this Relation, which I pray you, with 
 the enclosed Letter, deliver to my Lord Chamberlain, 
 And so, &ces: 
 Louvain the viijth: of 
 September, 1613:
 
 Yours: &ces 
 Edward Sackville:
