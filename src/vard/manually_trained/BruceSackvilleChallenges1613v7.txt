 praises: and fame the truest Almanac to tell you how much 
 I suffer And if you call to memory when I gave you my hand last

 were I not confident your honour gives you the same Courage to 
 do me right, that it did to do me wrong, Be Mr of your own 
 weapon and time, the place wheresoever, I will wait on you,

 opinion the world hath of both our Worths Ed: Bruise

 My Lord Bruce's answer
 
 A monsieur Monsieur Sackeville
 
 I have received Your letter by your man, and acknowledge 
 you have dealt nobly with me, and now I come with all possible 
 haste to see you. Edward Bruise
 
 Mr. Edward Sackville's Letter to A 
 Friend of the manner of the combat and 
 death betwixt him and the Lord Bruise 
 Baron of Kinloss 1613 
 Worthy Sr As I am not ignorant (so ought I to be 
 sensible) of the false aspersions some authorless tongues have 
 laid upon me, in the reports of the unfortunate passage late 
 lie happened between the Lord Bruise and my self, which as they 
 are spreed here, so may I justly fear they reign also where 
 you are There are but 2 ways to resolve doubts of this nature  
            by oath or sword, the first is due to Magistrates, and Communicable to friends, the other to such as maliciously slander 
 & impudently defend their assertion Your love not my merit 
 assures me you hold me a friend, which esteem I am so desirous 
 to retain; do me the right to understand the truth of that and 
 in my behalf inform others, who either are or may be infected 
 with sinister rumours much prejudicial to that fair opinion 
 I desire to hold amongst all worthy persons And on ye faith 
 of a gent’ ye relation I shall give you is neither more nor less the bare  Mr Sackville's relation of his Combat with: the Lord Bruise
 The enclosed contains the first Citation sent me from Paris 
 by a Scottish gent’ who delivered it to me in Derbyshire at my 
 father in Laws hows, After it follows my then answer 
 returned him by the same bearer; The next is ye accomplishment 
 of my first promise, being a particular assignation of place and 
 weapons, which I sent by a servant of mine by Post from Rotterdam 
 as soon as I landed there. The receipt of which joined with an acknowledgement of my too fair Courage towards the deceased Lord 
 is testified by ye last with periods that business till we met at 
 Tergoes in Zeeland it being the place allotted for Rendezvous who 
 he accompanied with one Mr Grayford an english gent’ for his 
 second, a Surgeon and a man, arrived with all the speed he could 
 and there having once rendered himself, I addressed my second 
 Sr John Heydon to let him understand, that now all followed  
 should be done by consent As concerning the terms, whereon 
 we should fight as also ye place to our seconds we gave power  
 for their appointments who agreed we should go to Antwerp 
 from thence to Bergen op zoom where in the midway, but a village 
 divides the states territory from the Archdukes And there was  
 the destined Stage; to the end that having ended he that 
 could might presently exempt himself from the justice of 
 the Country by retiring into the Dominion not offended, It 
 was further concluded, that in case any should fall or slip, 
 that then the Combat should cease & he whose ill fortune had 
 so subjected him was to acknowledge his life to have ben in ye 
 others hands, but in case one parties sword should break (because 
 that could only Chance by hazard) it was agreed that the other 
 take no advantage, but either then be made friends, or else upon 
 even terms go to it again, Thus their conclusions being by each 
 of them realted to his party; was by us both approved, & assented 
 unto Accordingly we embarked for Antwerp, and by reason 
 my Lord (as I conceive because he could not handsomely without 
 danger of discovery) had not paired the sword I sent him at 
 Paris, bringing one of the same length but twice as broad, my second 
 excepted against it, and advised me to match my own, and send 
 him the Choice; which I obeyed (it being as you know the challengers 
 privilege to elect his weapon) at the delivery of the swords, 
 which was performed by Sr John Heydon, it pleased the Lord 
 Bruise to Chose mine own, and Then (past expectation) he 
 told him that he found himself so far behind hand, as  
 little of my blood would not serve his turn; and therefore 
 he was now resolved to have me alone, because he knew 
 (for I will use his own words) that so worthy a gent’, and  
 my friend could not endure to stand by, and set him to do 
 that which he must to satisfy himself and his honour. Here 
 upon Sr John Heydon, replied such intentions were  Mr Sackville's relation of his combat with. ye Lord Bruise
 bloody and butchery far unfitting so noble a personage 
 who should desire to bleed for reputation not for life withal 
 adding he thought himself injured (being come thus far) 
 now to be prohibited from executing these honourable offices 
 he came for; The Lord for answer only reiterated his former 
 resolution, whereupon Sr John leaving him the sword he 
 had elected, delivered me the other, with his determinations, 
 the which (not for matter but manor) so moved me, as though 
 to my remembrance I had not of a long while eaten more 
 liberally then at diner, & therefore unfit for such an action 
 seeing ye Surgeons hold a wound upon a full stomach much 
 more dangerous then otherwise I requested my second to Cert 
 efie him, I would presently decide the difference and that 
 therefore he should immediately meet me on horseback at that 
 gate of the Town where the lots should direct us the names of 
 the ports being put into a hat, and he drawing it happened to be 
 the gate that led to Lilles of this course he accepted, & forth  
 with we met at the forenamed place where being searched by 
 our seconds, we were turned together on horseback only weighted on by our Surgeons they being unarmed, together 
 we rod (but one before the other some twelve score) about  
 some two English miles, & then passion having so weak an 
 enemy to assail, as my direction easily became victor, and  
 using his power made me obedient to his Commandment; I being  
 verily mad with. anger, the Lord Bruise should thirst after my 
 life with a kind of assuredness, seeing I had come so far, and 
 needlessly to give him leave to regain his lost reputation I 
 bad him alight with all willingness he quickly granted 
 & there in a meadow (ankle deep at least in water, bidding 
 fare well to our doublets in our shirts, began to Charge each 
 having a fore commanded our Surgeons to withdraw themselves 
 a pretty distance from us conjuring them besides as they respected 
            our favours or their own safety not to stir, but suffer us to execute our pleasures  we being fully resolved, (God forgive us) 
 to dispatch each other by what means we could I made A 
 thrust at mine Enemy but was short & in drawing back my 
 Arm I received a great wound with. a blow thereon which I 
 interpreted as a reward for my short shooting but in revenge 
 I pressed into him though I mist him also, and then received 
 a wound in my right pap which past level through my body 
 almost to my back and grappling together he catched hold on 
 my sword I on his, & there we wrestled for the too greatest 
 and dearest prises we could ever expect trial for honour Mr Sackville's relation of his and life in which straggling my hand 
 having but an ordinary Glove on it lost one of 
 her Servants (though the meanest) which hung by 
 a skin, and to sight yet remains as before, and I am 
 put in hope one day to have the use also; But at last breathless yet keeping our holds; there paste on both 
 sides propositions quitting each other Swords: But  
 when Amity was dead, Confidence could not Live, and who should quit first was the Question which on nether part either would perform, and restriving, a, fresh, 
 with a kick, and a wrench together , I freed my long 
 Captived weapon which incontinently Leaving at 
 his Throat (being Mr still of his), I demanded 
 if he would ask his life, or yield his Sword (though 
 in that eminent danger) he bravely denied to do, my self being wounded and feeling loss of blood having three Conduits running on me, began to 
 make me faint, and he Courageously persisting not 
 to Accord to either of my propositions, remembrance 
 of his former bloody desire, and feeling of my present 
 State, I struck at his heart, but with his avoiding 
 mist my aim, yet paste through the body, and 
 drawing through my Sword, repast it through 
 again, through another place, when he Cried, Oh 
 I am slain, Seconding his speech with all the  
 force he had, desirous to caste me; but being too 
 weak after I had defended his Assault, I easily became Mr of him, laying him on his back, when      
 I being over him, I redemanded, if he would 
 request his Life, but it seemed he prized it not 
 at so dear a Rate, to be beholding for it, bravely  
 replied, he scorned it, which Answer of his was 
 so noble and worthy, as I protest I could not 
            find in my heart to offer him any more Violence, only keeping him down, till at length 
 his Surgeon a far of Cried out immediately 
 he would dye if his wounds were not stopped whereupon I asked if he desired his Surgeon Combat with. the Lord Bruise
 Surgeon should come, which he accepted of 
 and so being drawn away, I never offered to take 
 his sword, accounting it inhumane to Rob a dead 
 man, for so I held him to be, This thus ended I retired to my Surgeon; in whose Arms, 
 after I had remained a while for want of 
 blood I lost my sight and with all this (as I  
 then thought), my life also, but strong water, 
 and his diligence quickly recovered me, when 
 I escaped a great danger, for my Lots: Surgeon 
 when no body dreamed of it ran full at 
 me, with his Lords Sword, and had not mine  
 with my Sword interposed himself, I had 
 been slain by those Base hands, although 
 the Lord Bruise then weltering in his blood, 
 and past expectation of Life (Conformable to 
 all his former Carriage which was undaunted  
 and noble) cried out, Rascal hold thy hands. 
 So may I prosper as I have dealt sincerely 
 with you in this Relation, the which I 
 pray with the enclosed deliver to my Lord 
 Chamberlain:
 
 Louvain this Sixth of 
 September Anno: 1613
