            <h2><a id="introduction">Introduction</a></h2>

            <p><em>Manuscript Pamphleteering in Early Stuart England</em> brings together bibliographical data,
                texts (transcriptions) and manuscript images to help students and scholars access the rich world of
                early Stuart handwritten political discourse. This introductory essay is intended: to explain what we
                mean by 'manuscript pamphleteering' and 'manuscript pamphlet'; to give some context to the production,
                circulation and reception of these works; and to explain how the resources here relate to the
                historical phenomenon – that is, what has been included and what has been left out.</p>

            <p>In our usage, a manuscript pamphlet is a handwritten text, usually from a particular set of genres –
                speeches, letters, petitions, briefs, treatises, dialogues – that circulated through the particular
                matrix of scribal practices that prevailed in early Stuart England. Thomas Alured's
                <em><a href="../t/AluredLetterBuckingham1620v1.html">Letter to the Marquess of Buckingham</a></em>
                (1620), for example, was originally composed as an
                intervention in the marriage-treaty negotiations that Britain was conducting with Habsburg Spain in
                1620, and briefly landed the author in prison; it was also copied by hand and sold commercially by
                professional scribes and manuscript dealers. Handwritten copies circulated throughout the kingdom,
                and contemporary transcripts survive in the notebooks of clergymen and gentlemen from Norfolk to
                Shropshire and from Kent to Cornwall. The goal of this resource is to give students and scholars
                better access to the sorts of texts that belonged to the world of Alured's <em>Letter.</em></p>

            <h2><a id="why_copy_hand">Why copy by hand?</a></h2>

            <p>By the late sixteenth century, England had a well-established and well-regulated printing industry,
                based partly in the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge but mostly in the rapidly expanding metropolis
                of London. Nevertheless, for a great many tasks, early modern men and women preferred hand-copying to
                printing. There are four reasons for this.</p>

            <p>First, in many circumstances, copying out something by hand was simply <em>easier</em> than arranging
                for it to be printed. To get something printed, someone had to physically bring the handwritten text
                to the printer's shop, negotiate a price with the proprietor, and wait for the job to be finished.
                Alternatively, a writer might negotiate with a stationer, who could provide the capital needed for
                larger print runs. Printing required the time-consuming process of setting type in the first place, but
                after this was completed, multiplying copies was much faster than hand copying. Printing was a better
                option if you needed dozens or hundreds of copies. To make a single copy of a text of a few hundred
                words, it was much easier and faster to dash off a copy yourself (or, better yet, task a servant or
                professional copyist with doing it). These incentives were multiplied if you lived any distance from
                London, where the printing industry was mainly based, since in the early seventeenth century travel
                time was measured in days or weeks instead of hours. If you wanted to copy a recipe, poem or speech
                for a friend in Chester or Shrewsbury or Exeter, hand-copying was the obvious medium to use.</p>

            <p>Secondly, certain industries and professions – notably, lawyers – had developed working methods or
                practices based on the production and circulation of handwritten material, and these practices were
                very resistant to change. In the early seventeenth century, legal documents – land deeds, indentures,
                contracts, wills and pleadings of all sorts – were all handwritten. So were most 'reports', or informal
                records of legal decisions that were part of legal education. The late Tudor and early Stuart period was
                a notoriously litigious age (one scholar has estimated the total number of actions begun in the kingdom
                at a million a year), and the documents produced in and for that litigation were written by a huge,
                dispersed army of legal clerks and scriveners. Many such documents could have been printed, and indeed
                in later centuries were printed; but in the early seventeenth century they were written by hand, often
                at enormous expense. Movements for legal reform did try to limit the costs associated with hand-copying,
                but there were more pressing problems with the legal system, such as competing and overlapping
                jurisdictions, and the fact that much of the pleading was still conducted in a form of French. If you
                were involved in the legal system, and most people were at some point in their lives, you would have to
                deal with handwritten documents.</p>

            <p>Thirdly, some scholars have suggested certain kinds of works were more highly valued in manuscript than
                in print. The so-called 'stigma of print' supposedly made certain authors of, for example, lyric poetry,
                and living in particular social contexts, prefer manuscript to print in order to lend their work more
                dignity, or to limit exposure to small groups of readers, or even a single reader. Certainly, certain
                genres, particularly examples of English oratory, appear to have circulated exclusively in handwritten
                forms, though why precisely this was the case is not always clear. As any single manuscript naturally
                limited the size of its readership, access to manuscript copies of works was at times a matter of
                privilege, or of knowing the right kinds of people. Accordingly, scholars have long been interested in
                the ways in which manuscripts served small communities, connected by ways of
                family, kinship, profession, religious or political persuasion, and so on. The ways in which certain
                communities shared certain kinds of texts tells us much both about these people, and about the
                texts.</p>

            <p>Finally, some works were considered too dangerous to print. Although print regulation or censorship was
                never exhaustive or systematic, it was nevertheless quite effective. Clandestine printing could be very
                costly and dangerous; master printers were rarely willing to risk their privileges by printing something
                offensive to the government; and, given the relatively small number of printers and printing presses, it
                was often quite straightforward for the government to discover who was responsible for a piece of
                illicit print. Nevertheless, numerous groups wanted to air views outside the permitted mainstream: some
                were political or religious dissidents – critics of policy in church or state, or Roman Catholic or
                Puritan separatists – while others were supporters of the Stuart regime, whose views on the extent of
                royal authority or the importance of religious conformity were considered too extreme for a public
                hearing. For these groups, manuscript was a relatively accessible medium. An easy way to see this
                dynamic in action is with works like Thomas Scott's
                <em><a href="../t/ScottVoxPopuli1620.html">Vox Populi</a></em> (1620),
                a criticism of the regime policy of rapprochement with Spain, or George Eglisham's
                <em><a href="../t/EglishamForerunnerRevenge1626.html">Forerunner of Revenge</a></em> (1626),
                which accused a prominent courtier of murdering the recently-deceased King James I.
                Both were initially printed, but demand soon outstripped the small clandestinely produced supply, and
                both were often copied by hand.</p>

            <p>From this cacophony of forces and incentives emerged the phenomenon we call <em>manuscript
                pamphleteering</em>. Manuscript pamphleteering refers primarily to a set of copying and circulation
                practices through which certain works became known to (some) readers. We will refer to works that were
                taken up by these practices as <em>manuscript pamphlets</em>.</p>

            <h2><a id="who_copied">Who copied out manuscript pamphlets?</a></h2>

            <p>One of the biggest obstacles to the study of manuscript pamphleteering is <em>scribal anonymity</em>: in
                the vast
                majority of cases, copyists did not sign their names to a piece of work, so it is very difficult to know
                who was responsible for the writing. Even copyists who had very distinctive handwriting, and whose work
                survives in many examples, often remain anonymous: the 'Feathery Scribe', identified by Hilton Kelliher
                and Peter Beal, is the most famous. Dozens of examples of Feathery's handwriting have survived (a few
                <a href="../p/P0108.html">feature in our database</a>), and we can work out a bit about where he was
                working and who his colleagues were, but we do not know for certain who he was.</p>

            <p>One thing we can say about Feathery is that he was a professional: he wrote out manuscripts for money,
                and this was almost certainly his main occupation. At various points in his career, Feathery appeared to
                be part of a 'shop' or team of manuscript-copyists who wrote out texts for sale to clients. These
                manuscript copyists probably had a catalogue that clients could consult to choose which works they
                wanted copied (in fact, there are a few surviving examples of such catalogues, including <a
                        href="../t/SeparateCataloguev1.html">here</a>).
                The prices they charged were probably very high: surviving evidence (again, quite limited)
                suggests that buying manuscripts from Feathery and his associates was an order of magnitude more
                expensive than buying cheaply printed books: a few shillings rather than a few pennies.</p>

            <p>But Feathery and his associates were a luxury, professional operation, mostly serving wealthy clients. In
                early Stuart England, avoiding printing presses meant avoiding copyright, and set very low barriers to
                entry: instead of having to belong to a special guild, anyone with a pen could decide to become a
                manuscript copyist. And so there were many other people – schoolteachers, chaplains, secretaries,
                apprentices, legal clerks – who wrote manuscript pamphlets for money, often as a side job. Such people
                seem to have charged much lower prices, from one-fifth to one-third what a prestigious operation like
                Feathery's would have charged. Thanks to the work of part-time copyists, manuscript pamphlets could
                sometimes be bought not only from dedicated manuscript-dealers but in lawyers' chambers, from
                scriveners, or in bookshops. When a particular item was in great demand, part-time copyists would
                sometimes jump into the market, increasing the supply.</p>

            <p>Most copying probably was not commercial; it was instead what the scholar Harold Love called 'user
                publication'. Members of communities (or coteries), however loosely associated, helped each other out: a
                person who had a manuscript text might show it to his or her friends; one of those friends might want a
                copy for himself or herself, and so ask to borrow the copy for a few days; and so on. These
                copying-chains were an important mode of circulation everywhere, even in London where commercial copying
                also thrived. Outside London, it was essential. The clergyman John Rous, whose parish straddled Norfolk
                and Suffolk, borrowed texts from his circle of friends and acquaintances, especially when they met
                together for assizes or ecclesiastical visitations. On the other side of England, in Shropshire, the
                clergyman Robert Horne had a similar network of friends and associates, who shared texts amongst
                themselves. Gentlemen with interests in manuscript collection could make stately homes into centres of
                manuscript reproduction: a manuscript now in the University of London was copied at Sir Roger Mostyn's
                house in Flintshire, from a volume that was brought there by Mostyn's visiting son-in-law, Richard
                Grosvenor. Other texts were written out in the universities, professional organisations like the Inns of
                Court, country alehouses or inns, workplaces, or anywhere where travellers met and talked about the
                news.</p>

            <p>Together, this multiplicity of practices, commercial and sociable, metropolitan and provincial, produced
                a huge volume of copies – on the order of ten thousand surviving examples, with no obvious way of
                knowing what proportion that represents of the original quantity produced. These survive in a
                multiplicity of forms: as <a href="../t/PoorMansPetition1603v2.html">unbound paper separates</a>, or
                <a href="../t/WilliamsPetitionCharles1640.html">copied into newsletters</a>, <a
                        href="../t/ProphecyMerlin1622.html">personal diaries</a>
                or <a href="../t/MontaguLetterFather1635.html">commercially produced volumes</a>. The photographs of
                manuscripts have been
                chosen to illustrate this range.</p>

            <h2><a id="what_kinds">What kinds of works became manuscript pamphlets?</a></h2>

            <p>For the most part, though not exclusively, manuscript pamphlets were concerned with recent events or the
                near past. The paradigmatic manuscript pamphlet is perhaps the transcript of a speech delivered by a
                significant legal or political figure (such as the philosopher, lawyer and statesman Francis Bacon) on a
                particular occasion (perhaps at the arraignment of a disgraced courtier, or the elevation of a judge).
                There are also: position papers on particular government policies, like Robert Cotton's remarks On the
                <em><a href="../t/CottonCoin1626.html">Alteration of the Coin</a></em> (1626); apologies for, or
                attacks on, major public figures, like William Tourneur's
                <em><a href="../t/TurneurCharacterSalisbury.html">Character of the Earl of Salisbury</a></em> (1612)
                or William Fleetwood's
                <em><a href="../t/FleetwoodUnhappyViewWholeBehaviourBuckinghamFrenchIsland1627.html">Unhappy View of
                    the Whole Behaviour of the Duke of Buckingham at the French Island</a></em> (1627); important
                criminal trials, such as the trials of those involved in
                the <a href="../results.html?search=overbury+affair&amp;keyword-type=all">Overbury Poisoning</a>
                (1615-15) or of the Puritan pamphleteers
                <a href="../results.html?search=Burton+Bastwick+Prynne&amp;keyword-type=all">Henry Burton, John Bastwick
                    and William Prynne</a> (1637); and elaborate considerations on recent events, like the
                <a href="../t/FiveYearsKingJames1625-8.html">Five Years of King James</a> or
                <a href="../t/TomTellTroth1622.html">Tom Tell-Troth</a>. English foreign policy and news from abroad
                also featured extensively, as did works concerned with religious controversies at home and abroad.
                Beyond these paradigms, we have included some works and genres that reflect on essentially political
                events or figures of the recent times in more oblique ways, for
                example, a number of prophecies, or poems (but cf. below on what is not contained in the database).</p>

            <p>These works have many important and interesting features, which this essay cannot explore in any depth
                (see '<a href="#further_reading">Further Reading</a>' below for more sustained analyses of particular
                items or genres). A few minor points are worth making:</p>

            <p>First, and perhaps most obviously, a very large proportion of the manuscript pamphlets described here had
                content that would have made them difficult or dangerous to put into print before the Stuart regime
                began to collapse in late 1640 and 1641. Where print has demanded scholars 'read behind the lines'
                in order to see how the authors of printed books might be responding to current events, the discourse
                of manuscript pamphlets tends to be much more overt. This does not mean the works are straightforward
                – far from it – but rather than hiding their references to current or near-current events under
                allusions or deniable parallels, the writers of manuscript pamphlets tended to draw those connections
                openly.</p>

            <p>Secondly, the <em>occasional</em>, or <em>historical</em>, nature of these works is quite distinctive;
                readers and copyists were often very interested in the circumstances under which the work was composed,
                who composed it, and why. When these details are missing from a particular work they were often
                supplied conjecturally by readers: anonymous works were regularly attributed to particular authors;
                undated or misdated texts were often assigned to particular times, all by contemporary readers.
                Different copies of the same work vary, sometimes considerably; many contemporary were alert to this
                aspect of manuscript circulation, and compared or collated variant copies when they could.</p>

            <p>Finally, many of the works in the MPESE database are not quite what they appear to be. For example, the
                work we have titled <em><a href="../t/PseudoAbbot1623v1.html">Pseudo Abbot</a></em> (1623) presented
                itself as a speech delivered at the Privy Council board by Archbishop George Abbot. In the speech,
                Abbot spoke eloquently against some concessions made by King James I to the King of Spain with respect
                to the toleration of Roman Catholicism. In real life, Abbot never made the
                speech, and insisted he had nothing whatever to do with it. The work was a forgery, foisted on Abbot by
                an anonymous pamphleteer.</p>

            <h2><a id="missing">What is missing from this database?</a></h2>
            <p>The MPESE database does not (yet) contain everything that was passing through early modern manuscript
                culture. In other words, it is important <em>not</em> to take what we've presented as being a full
                inventory of what
                was circulating in manuscript in early Stuart England. However, with consideration of what has been left
                out, we hope that such a synoptic view might in fact be possible.</p>

            <p>Four sorts of things have been systematically excluded from the database:</p>

            <p>A) Verse (and other overtly literary forms, e.g., drama). Many of the texts that people copied and then
                circulated among one another were in verse, while only a very small number of verses have been included
                in this collection. We have excluded both 'literary' verse, by the likes of John Donne, William Herbert
                and Robert Herrick, so-called coterie poets who circulated their work in handwriting; and most topical
                verse or libels. Both are covered by existing resources: the former by the
                <em><a href="http://www.celm-ms.org.uk">Catalogue of English Literary Manuscripts</a></em>
                (CELM), compiled by Peter Beal; and the second by
                <em><a href="http://www.earlystuartlibels.net">Early Stuart Libels</a></em>, edited by Alastair Bellany
                and Andrew McRae. We ultimately aim to include topical verse that escaped the notice of
                <em>Early Stuart Libels</em>, and have included a handful of examples, but generally speaking poems
                have been left out.</p>

            <p>B) Parliamentary documents. Parliamentary speeches, declarations, remonstrances and other documents
                originating in Parliament were widely circulated in manuscript. Or some of them were; as Millstone has
                demonstrated, the proportion of parliamentary material entering the matrix of manuscript reproduction
                escalated sharply in the 1620s but was never comprehensive. Although this resource does not provide a
                survey of parliamentary manuscript circulation, much of the data for such a survey has been collected
                and can be obtained from
                <a href="https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/staff/profiles/history/millstone-noah.aspx">Dr Millstone
                    directly</a>. Many parliamentary manuscript separates have been printed in the modern editions of
                the parliamentary debates.</p>

            <p>C) Tudor survivals. A number of documents originally composed in the Tudor era were copied and circulated
                alongside early Stuart materials. These included a widely copied letter of Anne Boleyn; an account of
                the trial and execution of Thomas Howard, duke of Norfolk; the Catholic libel Leicester's
                <em>Commonwealth</em>; an Apology of Philip Howard, earl of Arundel; a number of orations attributed
                to Sir Nicholas Bacon; Sir Philip Sidney's Letter on the Anjou match; and a number of documents

            <p>D) Sermons. Whereas sermons are obviously different works in kind and purpose from our manuscript
                pamphlets in many ways, the pulpits were places where political issues were discussed in depth, and
                some were in fact sites of significant dissent. Manuscript sermons are currently being catalogue by a
                project that is akin to ours: the 'Gateway to Early Modern Manuscript Sermons'
                (see <a href="#further_reading">Further Reading for details</a>).</p>

            <p>These four categories of material were very often copied and transmitted in the same ways as the
                materials that are included in the present database; indeed, they often occur in the same collections
                in the same hands. For a proper understanding of early Stuart manuscript culture as a whole, it
                would be necessary to add these materials into the mix.</p>

            <p>There is a final category of excluded material: items that we have good reason to believe did in fact
                circulate in manuscript, but for which no manuscript examples have yet come to light. Many books that
                were printed later (often in the 1640s) refer to, or even reproduce, material that was said to have
                circulated in manuscript during the early Stuart era. These claims are often plausible, if not
                always verifiable.</p>

            <h2><a id="what_happened">What happened to all these texts after the early Stuart period?</a></h2>

            <p>It is almost certain that the majority, and probably the vast majority, of the manuscript pamphlets
                produced during the early Stuart period have been lost.</p>

            <p>Luckily, some copies of the manuscript pamphlets remained among the personal papers and libraries
                of people who owned them. Many of them had been collectors, and the impulse to collect continued to be a
                major force for the accumulation and dispersal of these materials over time. Papers collected by Sir
                Simonds D'Ewes in the 1620s became part of a larger collection put together by the Harleys in the
                eighteenth century, before being acquired by the British Museum. The papers collected by the Shropshire
                clergyman Robert Horne in the late 1610s were acquired by Richard Rawlinson in the eighteenth century,
                finally coming to rest in the Bodleian Library. Other copies remain among the papers of the family or
                corporation that originally acquired them, either in local record offices or in aristocratic collections
                like Woburn Abbey or Alnwick Castle.</p>

            <p>A few of these texts were printed in the early Stuart era itself; many more were printed during the
                Civil War and Interregnum periods. The texts of manuscript pamphlets have also been reprinted as
                part of the waves of antiquarian and historical publication that began in the 1650s and have
                continued ever since. We have indicated what we know about the print history of the pamphlets,
                though this has not in all cases been systematically investigated.</p>
