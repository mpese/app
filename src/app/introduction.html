            <h1>Introductory Essay</h1>

            <p><em>Manuscript
                Pamphleteering in Early Stuart England </em>brings together bibliographic data,
                texts (transcriptions) and manuscript images to help students and scholars
                access the rich world of early Stuart handwritten political discourse. This
                introductory essay is intended to explain what we mean by 'manuscript
                pamphleteering' and 'manuscript pamphlet'; to give some context to the
                production, circulation and reception of these works; and explain how the
                resources here relate to the historical phenomenon: that is, what has been
                included and what has been left out.</p>

            <p>In our usage, a manuscript pamphlet is a handwritten text,
                usually from a particular set of genres – speeches, letters,
                petitions, briefs, treatises, dialogues – that circulated through the
                particular matrix of scribal practices that prevailed in early Stuart England.
                Thomas Alured's <em>Letter to the Marquess of
                    Buckingham</em> (1620) [link here], for example, was originally composed as an
                intervention in the marriage treaty negotiations that Britain was conducting
                with Habsburg Spain in 1620, and briefly landed the author in prison; it was
                also copied by hand and sold commercially by professional scribes and
                manuscript dealers. Handwritten copies circulated throughout the kingdom, and
                contemporary transcripts survive in the notebooks of clergymen and gentlemen
                from Norfolk to Shropshire and from Kent to Cornwall. The goal of this resource
                is to give students and scholars better access to the sorts of texts that
                belonged to the world of Alured's <em>Letter</em>.</p>

            <h2>Why copy by hand?</h2>

            <p>By the late sixteenth century, England had a
                well-established and well-regulated printing industry, based partly in the
                Universities of Oxford and Cambridge but mostly in the rapidly expanding
                metropolis of London. Nevertheless, for a great many tasks, early modern men
                and women preferred hand-copying to printing. There are four reasons for this.</p>

            <p>First, in many circumstances, copying out something by hand
                was simply <em>easier</em> than arranging for
                it to be printed. To get something printed, someone had to physically bring the
                handwritten text to the shop, negotiate a price with the proprietor, and wait
                for the job to be finished. Alternatively, a writer might negotiate with a
                publisher, who could provide the capital needed for larger print runs. Printing
                required the time-consuming process of setting type in the first place, but
                after this was completed, multiplying copies was much faster than hand copying.
                Printing was a better option if you needed dozens or hundreds of copies. To
                make a single copy of a text of a few hundred words long, it was much easier
                and faster to dash off a copy yourself (or, better yet, task a servant with
                doing it). These incentives were multiplied if you lived any distance from
                London, where the printing industry was based, since in the early seventeenth
                century travel time was measured in days or weeks instead of hours. If you
                wanted to copy a recipe, poem or speech for a friend in Chester or Shrewsbury
                or Exeter, hand-copying was the obvious medium to use.</p>

            <p>Second, certain industries and professions – notably,
                lawyers – had developed working methods or practices based on the production
                and circulation of things in handwriting, and these practices were very
                resistant to change. In the early seventeenth century, legal documents – land
                deeds, indentures, contracts, wills, and pleadings of all sorts – were all
                handwritten. So were most 'reports', or informal records of legal decisions
                that were part of legal education. The late Tudor-early Stuart period was a notoriously
                litigious age (one scholar has estimated the total number of actions begun in
                the kingdom at a million a year), and the documents produced in and for that
                litigation was written out by a huge, dispersed army of legal clerks. Many of
                these sorts of documents could have been printed, and indeed in later centuries
                were printed; but in the early seventeenth century they were written out by
                hand, often at enormous expense. Movements for legal reform did try to limit
                the enormous costs associated with hand-copying, but there were more pressing
                problems with the legal system, such as competing and overlapping
                jurisdictions, and the fact that much of the pleading was still conducted in a
                form of French. If you were involved in the legal system, and most people were
                at some point in their lives, you would have to deal with handwritten
                documents.</p>

            <p>Third, some scholars have suggested certain kinds of texts
                were more highly valued in manuscript than in print. The so-called 'stigma of
                print' supposedly made certain authors of, for example, lyric poetry, prefer
                manuscript to print in order to lend their work more dignity, or to limit
                exposure to small groups of readers, or even a single reader. Certainly certain
                genres of texts, particularly examples of English oratory, appear to have
                circulated exclusively in handwriting, though why precisely this was the case
                is not always clear. As any single manuscript naturally limited the size of a
                readership, access to them was at times a matter of privilege, or knowing the
                right kinds of people. Accordingly, scholars have long been interested in the
                ways in which manuscripts served small communities (often termed 'coteries'),
                connected by ways of family, kinship, profession, religious or political
                persuasion, and so on. The ways in which certain communities shared certain
                kinds of texts tells us much both about these people, and about the texts. </p>

            <p>Fourth, some works were considered too dangerous to print.
                Although print regulation or censorship was never exhaustive or systematic, it
                was nevertheless quite effective. Clandestine printing could be very costly and
                dangerous; master printers were rarely willing to risk their privileges by
                printing something offensive to the government; and given the relatively small
                number of printers and printing presses, it was often quite straightforward for
                the government to discover who was responsible for a piece of illicit print.
                Nevertheless, numerous groups wanted to air views outside the permitted
                mainstream: some were political or religious dissidents, while others were
                supporters of the Stuart regime, whose views on the extent of royal authority
                or the importance of religious conformity were considered too extreme for a
                public hearing. For these groups, manuscript was a relatively accessible
                medium. An easy way to see this dynamic in action is with works like Thomas
                Scott's <em>Vox Populi</em> (1620) or George
                Eglisham's <em>Forerunner of Revenge</em> (1626).
                Both works were initially printed, but demand soon outstripped the small
                clandestinely-produced supply, and both works often copied by hand.</p>

            <p>From this cacophony of forces and incentives emerged the
                phenomenon we call <em>manuscript pamphleteering.</em> Manuscript pamphleteering refers primarily to a
                set of
                copying and circulation practices, through which certain texts became known to
                (some) readers. We will refer to texts that were taken up by these practices as
                <em>manuscript pamphlets</em>.</p>

            <h2>Who copied out manuscript pamphlets?</h2>

            <p>One of the biggest obstacles to the study of manuscript
                pamphleteering is <em>scribal anonymity</em>:
                in the vast majority of cases, copyists did not sign their names to a piece of
                work, so it is very difficult to know who was responsible for doing the writing.
                Even copyists who had very distinctive handwriting, and whose work survive in
                many examples, often remain anonymous: the 'Feathery Scribe' identified by
                Peter Beal is the most famous example. Dozens of examples of Feathery's
                handwriting have survived (and a few feature in our database: for instance,
                [link here]), and we can work out a bit about where he was working and who his
                colleagues were, but we have no idea <em>who</em> he was.</p>

            <p>One thing we can say about Feathery is that he was a
                professional: he wrote out manuscripts for money, and this was almost certainly
                his main occupation. At various points in his career, Feathery appeared to be
                part of a 'shop' or team of manuscript-copyists who wrote out texts for sale to
                clients. These manuscript copyists probably had a catalogue that clients could
                consult to choose which texts they wanted copied (and in fact there are a few
                surviving examples of such catalogues, including here: [link here]). The prices
                they charged were probably very, very high: surviving evidence (again, quite
                limited) suggests that buying manuscripts from Feathery and his associates was
                an order of magnitude more expensive than buying cheaply printed works: a few
                shillings rather than a few pennies.</p>

            <p>But Feathery and his associates were a luxury, professional
                operation, mostly serving gentle clients. In early Stuart England, no printing
                presses meant no copyrights, and very low barriers to entry: instead of having
                to belong to a special guild, anyone with a pen could decide to become a
                manuscript copyist. And so there were many other people – schoolteachers,
                apprentices, legal clerks – who wrote manuscript pamphlets for money, often as
                a side job. Such people seem to have charged much lower prices, from one-fifth
                to one-third what a prestigious operation like Feathery's would have charged.
                Thanks to the work of part-time copyists, manuscript pamphlets could sometimes
                be bought not only from dedicated manuscript-dealers but also in lawyers'
                chambers, from scriveners, or in bookshops. When a particular item was in great
                demand, part time copyists would sometimes jump into the market, increasing the
                supply.</p>

            <p>Probably, most copying was not commercial; it was instead
                what the scholar Harold Love called 'user publication'. Members of communities
                (or coteries), however loosely associated, helped each other out: a person who
                had a manuscript text might show it to his or her friends; one of those friends
                might want a copy for himself, and so ask to borrow the copy for a few days;
                and so on. These copying-chains were an important mode of circulation
                everywhere, even in London where commercial copying also thrived. Outside of
                London, it was essential. The clergyman John Rous, whose parish straddled
                Norfolk and Suffolk, borrowed texts from his circle of friends and
                acquaintances, especially when they met together for assizes or ecclesiastical
                visitations. On the other side of England, in Shropshire, the clergyman Robert
                Horne had a similar network of friends and associates, who shared texts amongst
                each other. Gentlemen with interests in manuscript collection could make
                stately homes into centres of manuscript reproduction: a manuscript now in the
                University of London was copied at Sir Roger Mostyn's house in Flintshire, from
                a volume that was brought there by Mostyn's visiting son-in-law, Sir Richard
                Grosvenor. Other texts were written out in universities, professional
                organisations like the Inns of Court, country alehouses or inns, workplaces, or
                anywhere where travellers met and talked about the news.</p>

            <p>Together, this multiplicity of practices, commercial and
                sociable, metropolitan and provincial, produced a huge volume of copies – on
                the order of ten thousand <em>surviving</em>
                examples, with no obvious way of knowing what proportion that represents of the
                original quantity produced.</p>

            <h2>What kinds of texts became manuscript pamphlets?</h2>

            <p>For the most part, though not exclusively, manuscript
                pamphlets were concerned with recent events or the near past. The paradigmatic
                manuscript pamphlet is perhaps the transcript of a speech delivered by a
                significant legal or political figure (such as the philosopher, lawyer and
                statesman Francis Bacon) on a particular occasion (perhaps at the arraignment
                of a disgraced courtier, or the elevation of a judge). There are also position
                papers on particular government policies, like Robert Cotton's remarks <em>On the
                    Alteration of the Coin</em> (1626);
                apologies for, or attacks on, major public figures, like Turneur's <em> Character of the Earl of
                    Salisbury</em> (1612)
                or Fleetwood's <em>Unhappy View of the Whole
                    Behaviour of the Duke of Buckingham at the French Island </em>(1627); important
                criminal trials, like for those involved in the Overbury Poisoning (1615-15) or
                of the Puritan pamphleteers Henry Burton, John Bastwick and William Prynne (1637);
                and elaborate considerations on recent events, like the <em>Five Years of King James </em>or <em>Tom
                    Tell-Troth</em>. English foreign policy and news from abroad also featured
                extensively, as did texts concerned with religious controversies at home and
                abroad. Beyond these paradigms, we have included some texts and genres that
                reflect on essentially political events or figures of the recent times in more
                oblique ways, for example, a number of prophecies, or poems (but cf. below on
                what is not contained in the database).</p>

            <p>These texts have many important and interesting features,
                which this essay cannot explore in any depth (see 'Further Reading' below for
                more sustained analyses of particular items or genres). A few minor points are
                worth making:</p>

            <p>First, and perhaps most obviously, a very large proportion
                of the manuscript pamphlets described here had content that would have made
                them difficult or dangerous to put into print before the Stuart regime began to
                collapse in late 1640 and 1641. Where print has demanded scholars 'read behind
                the lines' in order to see how they might be responding to current events, the
                discourse of manuscript pamphlets tends to be much more overt. This does not
                mean the texts are straightforward – far from it ­– but rather than hiding
                their references to current or near-current events under allusions or deniable
                parallels, manuscript pamphlets tend to draw those connections openly.</p>

            <p>Second, the <em>occasional</em>,
                or <em>historical</em>, nature of these texts is quite distinctive; readers and copyists
                were often very interested in the circumstances under which the text was
                composed, in who composed it, and why. When these details are missing from a
                particular texts they were often supplied conjecturally by readers: anonymous
                texts were regularly attributed to particular authors, undated or misdated
                texts were often assigned to particular times, all by contemporary readers.</p>

            <p>Finally, many of the texts in the MPESE database are not
                quite what they appear to be. For example, the text we have titled
                <em>Pseudo Abbot</em> (1623) presented itself as
                a speech delivered at the Privy Council board by Archbishop George Abbot. In
                the speech, Abbot spoke eloquently against some concessions made by King James
                I to the King of Spain with respect to the toleration of Roman Catholicism. In
                real life, Abbott never made the speech, and insisted he had nothing whatever
                to do with the text. The thing was a forgery, fostered on Abbot by an anonymous
                pamphleteer.</p>

            <h2>What is missing from this database?</h2>

            <p>The <em>MPESE</em> database
                does not (yet) contain everything that was passing through early modern
                manuscript culture. In other words, it is important <em>not</em>
                to take what we've presented as being a full inventory of what
                was circulating in manuscript in early Stuart England. However, with
                consideration of what has been left out, we hope that such a synoptic view
                might in fact be possible.</p>

            <p>Four sorts of things have been systematically excluded from
                the database:</p>

            <p>A) Verse (and other overtly literary forms, e.g., drama).
                Many of the texts that people copied and circulated around to one another were
                in verse, while only a very small number of verses have been included in this
                collection. We have excluded both 'literary' verse, by the likes of John Donne,
                William Herbert and Robert Herrick, so-called coterie poets who circulated
                their work in handwriting; and most topical verse or libels. Both are covered
                by existing resources: the former by the <em>Catalogue
                    of English Literary Manuscripts</em> (CELM), edited by Peter Beal; and the
                second by <em>Early Stuart Libels</em>, edited
                by Alastair Bellany and Andrew McRae. We ultimately aim to include topical
                verse that escaped the notice of <em>Early
                    Stuart Libels</em>, and have included a handful of examples, but generally
                speaking poems have been left out.</p>

            <p>B) Parliamentary documents. Parliamentary speeches,
                declarations, remonstrances, and other documents originating in parliament were
                widely circulated in manuscript. Or <em>some</em> of
                them were; as Millstone has demonstrated, the proportion of parliamentary
                material entering the matrix of manuscript reproduction escalated sharply in
                the 1620s but was never comprehensive. Although this resource does not provide
                a survey of parliamentary manuscript circulation, much of the data for such a
                survey has been collected and can be obtained from Dr Millstone directly
                [contact details needed?].</p>

            <p>C) Tudor survivals. A number of documents originally
                composed in the Tudor era were copied and circulated alongside early Stuart
                materials. These included a widely-copied letter of Anne Boleyn; an account of
                the trial and execution of Thomas Howard, duke of Norfolk;
                the Catholic libel <em>Leicester's Commonwealth</em>; an <em>Apology</em> of Philip Howard,
                earl of Arundel; a number of orations attributed to Sir
                Nicholas Bacon; Sir Philip Sidney's <em>Letter</em> on the Anjou match; and a number of documents
                relating to the rise and fall of Robert Devereux, second earl of Essex.</p>

            <p>D) Sermons. Whereas sermons are obviously different texts in
                kind and purpose from our manuscript pamphlets in many ways, the pulpits were
                places where political issues were discussed in depth, and some were in fact
                sites of significant dissent. Manuscript sermons are currently being catalogue
                by a project that is akin to ours: the 'Gateway to Early Modern Manuscript
                Sermons' (see Further Reading for details). </p>

            <p>These four categories of material were very often copied and
                transmitted in the same ways as the materials that <em>are</em> included in the
                present database; indeed, often occurring in
                the same collections in the same hands. For a proper understanding of early
                Stuart manuscript culture as a whole, it would be necessary to add these
                materials back into the mix.</p>

            <p>There is a final category of excluded material: items that
                we have good reason to believe did in fact circulate in manuscript, but for
                which no manuscript examples have yet come to light. Many books that were
                printed later (often in the 1640s) refer to, or even reproduce, material that
                was said to have circulated in manuscript during the early Stuart era. These
                claims are often plausible, if not always verifiable.</p>

            <h2>What happened to all these texts now?</h2>

            <p>Many copies of the manuscript pamphlets remained among the
                personal papers and libraries of people who owned them. Many had been
                collectors, and the impulse to collect continued to be a major force for the
                accumulation and dispersal of these materials over time. Papers collected by
                Sir Simonds D'Ewes in the 1620s became part of a larger collection put together
                by the Harleys in the eighteenth century, before being acquired by the British
                Museum. The papers collected by the Shropshire clergyman Robert Horne in the
                late 1610s were acquired by Richard Rawlinson in the eighteenth century,
                finally coming to rest in the Bodleian Library. Other copies remain in the
                papers of the family or corporation that originally acquired them, either in
                local record offices or in aristocratic collections like Woburn Abbey or
                Alnwick Castle. </p>

            <p>A few of these texts were printed in the early Stuart era
                itself; many more were printed during the Civil War and Interregnum periods.
                The texts of manuscript pamphlets have also been reprinted as part of the waves
                of antiquarian and historical publication that began in the 1650s and have
                continued ever since. We have indicated what we know about the print history of
                the pamphlets, though this has not in all cases been systematically
                investigated.</p>
