    <title>Manuscript Pamphleteering in Early Stuart England</title>
    <abstract>
        <em>Manuscript Pamphleteering in Early Stuart England</em> is an AHRC-funded project that
        will map a large but little-known corpus of handwritten political pamphlets that were
        composed in England between the Stuart accession (1603) and the outbreak of Civil War
        (1642).</abstract>
    <description>
        <p>Before the outbreak of Civil War in 1642, England developed a large, influential and
            often radical pamphlet literature. Speeches, learned briefs, and scaffold apologies
            joined character assassinations, secret histories and conspiracy theories in a jumbled
            literary underground. Pamphlets were produced commercially and informally and circulated
            across the kingdom; they fascinated readers and influenced events. Large numbers of
            copies survive - probably in the tens of thousands - suggesting a significant
            readership. Nevertheless, this pamphlet literature is rarely mentioned and even more
            rarely analyzed by historians or literary critics, not least because it was written by
            hand rather than printed with movable type.</p>
        <p>This project aims to survey the vast hidden archive of early Stuart England's manuscript
            pamphlets. In collaboration with the British Library, this project will construct a
            database of manuscript pamphlet texts, bibliographic information, and digital images.
            This will allow users to search transcriptions of the pamphlets; analyze the
            distribution of copies through time and space; and see how such materials were
            presented: large and small, elaborate and plain, professional and amateur. The project
            will conduct additional research in the private papers of Francis Russell, fourth earl
            of Bedford, who was a major political figure of the early Stuart era as well as a reader
            and collector of manuscript pamphlets.</p>
        <p>The research has three main purposes. First, the project team and associated researchers
            will use the database to ask and answer fundamental questions about the content of early
            Stuart political ideas, the genres in which they were expressed, and the circulation of
            those ideas through the kingdom. Second, the studies produced by the project and the
            underlying dataset will be useful to historians, literary critics and scholars of
            political thought, providing a major new set of sources and a useful new set of research
            tools. Third, the project will prove useful to non-academic beneficiaries. Events at
            local archives, undertaken with the advice of the British Library, will raise the
            profile of the resource, and assist such archives and their users in capitalizing on
            manuscript pamphlets within their own collection; further, working in partnership with
            the Historical Association, the project will convene a Bristol-based group of secondary
            school teachers to help build a teaching resource for use in A-Level teaching, which
            will be available on the website and promoted by the Historical Association.</p>
