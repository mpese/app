    <title>Manuscript Pamphleteering in Early Stuart England</title>
    <abstract><em>Manuscript Pamphleteering in Early Stuart England</em> is an AHRC-funded project that will map 
        a large but little-known corpus of handwritten political pamphlets that were composed in England between 
        the Stuart accession (1603) and the outbreak of Civil War (1642).</abstract>
    <description><p>Before the outbreak of Civil War in 1642, England developed a large, influential and often 
        radical pamphlet literature. Speeches, learned briefs,  
        and scaffold apologies joined character assassinations, secret histories and  
        conspiracy theories in a jumbled literary underground. Pamphlets were produced 
        commercially and informally and circulated across the kingdom; they fascinated 
        readers and influenced events. Large numbers of copies survive - probably in 
        the tens of thousands - suggesting a significant readership. Nevertheless, 
        this pamphlet literature is rarely mentioned and even more rarely analyzed by 
        historians or literary critics, not least because it was written by hand rather 
        than printed with movable type.</p>
        <p>This project aims to survey the vast hidden archive of early Stuart 
            England's manuscript pamphlets. In collaboration with the British Library, 
            this project will construct a database of manuscript pamphlet texts, 
            bibliographic information, and digital images. This will allow users to 
            search transcriptions of the pamphlets; analyze the distribution of copies 
            through time and space; and see how such materials were presented: large 
            and small, elaborate and plain, professional and amateur. The project will 
            conduct additional research in the private papers of Francis Russell, fourth 
            earl of Bedford, who was a major political figure of the early Stuart era as 
            well as a reader and collector of manuscript pamphlets.</p></description>
