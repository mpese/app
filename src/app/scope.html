            <h1>Scope</h1>
            <p>This project aims to survey the vast hidden archive of early Stuart England's manuscript pamphlets.
                A large but little-known corpus of handwritten political pamphlets were composed in England between the
                Stuart accession (1603) and the outbreak of Civil War (1642). The project's main objective is to map the
                field of early Stuart manuscript pamphleteering, and to ask fundamental questions about the political
                and intellectual force, the reception, and the social and geographic reach of pre-revolutionary
                England;s extensive underground political literature. To this end, it provides a database of pamphlet
                texts, bibliographic information, transcriptions and digital images. It allows users to search
                transcriptions of the pamphlets; explore the scale and geographic scope of circulation; and see how such
                materials were presented: large and small, elaborate and plain, professional and amateur.</p>
            <p>To date, the project has primarily focused on extra-parliamentary texts circulating between 1603 and
                1642, with a view to understanding the transformation of political ideas in the decades leading
                up to civil war. Drawing upon the collections of xx archives in the UK and USA, the database details
                the circulation of over 500 distinct texts which collectively survive in over xx unique witnesses.
                Furthermore, it makes available transcriptions of over 180 exemplars, the majority of which are
                accompanied by high-resolution images. These have primarily been drawn from the collections of
                the British Library, a project partner, alongside others in local record offices such as Norfolk Record
                Office and Surrey History Centre. In some cases, we have provided multiple exemplars of a single
                text in order to demonstrate not only the range of material that circulated as manuscript pamphlets,
                but also the variety of forms this took and the range of scribal practices involved.</p>
                <p>For each text, the database lists basic bibliographic information, all known manuscript witnesses,
                and details of known print exemplars (both seventeenth-century and modern), as well as providing,
                where available, full-text versions of transcribed exemplars and high-resolution images. PDF versions
                of exemplars are available under the “Text Description” tab for each exemplar, as are the XML data
                    (encoded following <a href="http://www.tei-c.org/">TEI P5 guidelines</a>).</p>
            <h2>A note on terminology</h2>
                <p>The database distinguishes between “texts” (abstract documents in circulation), “witnesses”
                (specific physical manifestations of the texts) and “exemplars” (individual witnesses that have been
                    transcribed for the database).</p>
