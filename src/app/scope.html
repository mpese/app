            <h1>Scope</h1>
            <p>Drawing upon the collections of more than 50 archives in the UK and USA, <em>Manuscript Pamphleteering in
                Early Stuart England</em> details the circulation of over 500 distinct texts which collectively survive
                in around 4,000 unique witnesses. Furthermore, it makes available transcriptions of over 200 exemplars,
                the majority of which are accompanied by high-resolution images. These have primarily been drawn from
                the collections of the British Library, a project partner, alongside others in local record offices such
                as Norfolk Record Office and Surrey History Centre. In some cases, we have provided multiple exemplars
                of a single text in order to demonstrate not only the range of material that circulated as manuscript
                pamphlets, but also the variety of forms this took and the range of scribal practices involved.</p>
            <p>For each text, the database lists basic bibliographic information, all known manuscript witnesses, and
                details of known print exemplars (both seventeenth-century and modern). Where available, it also
                provides full-text versions of transcribed exemplars and high-resolution images. PDF versions of
                exemplars are available under the "Text Description" tab for each exemplar, as are the XML data (encoded
                following TEI P5 guidelines).</p>
            <h2>A note on terminology</h2>
            <p>The database distinguishes between "texts" (abstract documents in circulation), "witnesses" (specific
            physical manifestations of the texts) and "exemplars" (individual witnesses that have been transcribed for
                the database).</p>
            <h2>Next Steps</h2>
            <p>MPESE is a work in progress. We hope to improve it over time. Here some changes we hope to make going
                forward:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Finalizing proofreading for transcripts that are still marked as 'draft'.</li>
                <li>Supplying transcripts for texts that, as yet, have no transcribed witnesses.</li>
                <li>Enriching the text descriptions by supplying short introductions, and fuller information about
                    where texts have been printed.</li>
                <li>Enriching the manuscript descriptions, particularly describing the context and provenance of the
            manuscripts more fully and providing references to other paper and online catalogues (like the
                    <em>Catalogue of English Literary Manuscripts</em>).</li>
                <li>Adding additional texts (for example, material that we excluded but would like ultimately to
                    include) and manuscripts (for example, from archives we haven't visited yet).</li>
                <li>Improving browse and search functionality, with a particular focus on making the keywords more
                    systematic, and making it possible to browse by repository or restrict searches to particular
                    repositories.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We are open to accepting help with any of these. We particularly encourage users to send us additional
                data for inclusion, and we have had good experiences with groups of volunteers or students working
                together to produce transcripts. If this would be of interest, please contact
                <a href="https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/staff/profiles/history/millstone-noah.aspx">Dr Millstone</a>.</p>
