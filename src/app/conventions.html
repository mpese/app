            <h1>Transcription Conventions</h1>
            <p>In preparing pamphlet transcriptions, we have followed semi-diplomatic conventions that aim to
               record, encode and display versions of the text as faithfully as practically possible. Transcriptions and
                XML encoding have been undertaken by a number of project members and volunteers, using the following
                guidelines:</p>
            <table>
                <tr>
                    <td>[ ]</td>
                    <td>Expanded text</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>{ }</td>
                    <td>Unclear, missing or damaged text</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>&lt; &gt;</td>
                    <td>Marginalia and other additions</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><del>xyz</del></td>
                    <td>Deletions</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><sup>xyz</sup></td>
                    <td>Interlinear additions (displayed as superscript)</td>
                </tr>
            </table>
            <p>Original spelling, capitalisation and punctuation have been followed</p>
            <p>We have followed the original use of u/v and i/j</p>
            <p>Double &apos;f&apos; at the beginning of words has been transcribed as &apos;F&apos;</p>
            <p>Superscript formatting has not been retained, but where it indicates a contraction this has been expanded</p>
            <p>Thorns have been transcribed as &apos;[th]&apos; (e.g. &apos;ye&apos; becomes &apos;[th]e&apos;)</p>
            <p>NB. Although line breaks have been encoded in our XML data, they are not rendered on the website for ease of reading.</p>
