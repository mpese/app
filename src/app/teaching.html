            <h1>Teaching</h1>
            <p>We are very pleased to make available several teaching resources. They have been designed by a
                secondary school teacher, and are expressly designed for UK A-Level teachers delivering specifications
                on seventeenth-century history. Please feel free to modify the contents as needed. We welcome all
                feedback, and hope to add to the material here in the future.</p>
            <p>Resources created by Thomas Finch, Robert Napier School.</p>
