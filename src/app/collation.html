            <h2>Comparison Sets for Multiple Transcriptions</h2>
            <p>For several of the texts in the MPESE database, we have multiple transcriptions from different witnesses.
                There are many potential reasons why these might be helpful: for instance, to research textual
                variation, or scribal practice. To facilitate this, we have created comparison sets, using the freely
                available <a href="http://juxtacommons.org/">Juxta Commons website</a>.</p>
            <p>Note that these sets are best used alongside the transcriptions as published on the MPESE
               website. The Juxta interface normalises text to some degree in order to allow for easier
               visual comparison (for instance, at present the marginal notes to manuscript texts are not
               included here: the viewer only shows the main text). We have made available several
               'collation sets': you can view these side-by-side or as visual heat maps. There are further
                instruction on using Juxta available at the link above.</p>

            <p>Note: some of the MPESE texts, especially when associated with other paratext, are unlike each other in
               textual terms (e.g., ‘Statement on the Assassination of Buckingham’), in which case collation data is
                more challenging to navigate. For a clean example, see, e.g., 'Advertisement of a Loyal Subject'.</p>
